# MALAMA Project - Milestone 2 Summary

**Catalyst Proposal:** #1200230  
**Date:** February 2025  

---

## Overview

During **Milestone 2**, the MALAMA Project continued refining its **Cardano-based carbon tracking solution**, building upon insights from prior engagements with local landowners, government representatives, and the broader Cardano community. Our primary focus areas included:

1. **Deepening Community Engagement**  
   - Maintaining regular workshops, farm tours, and near-daily check-ins with **Paul & Jeffery** to ensure the platform meets real-world needs.

2. **Technical Advancements**  
   - Further testing and documenting the feasibility of **CIP-721 NFT** usage and **Plutus** integration.  
   - Implementing user feedback into the upcoming **beta dashboard**, aligning with the website enhancements at [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org).

3. **Market & Stakeholder Alignment**  
   - Enhancing marketing materials and demonstration tools to clarify the **value proposition** of on-chain sustainability tracking.  
   - Preparing for a broader pilot phase by incorporating early feedback from landowners, the Maui Farmers Association (anonymous), and Senator Lee’s office.

All related reports, including details on community engagement, technical feasibility, and workshop outcomes, are included in this repository (see **Updated README** for links).

## Willingness to Engage with Auditors

We encourage **auditors** and **community advisors** to reach out with any questions or requests for clarification. We stand ready to:

- Demonstrate private commits or code snippets as needed (subject to ongoing security considerations).  
- Organize video calls or further meetings to discuss improvements, data privacy, and user experience refinements.  
- Collaborate on suggestions that strengthen MALAMA’s impact and alignment with Cardano Catalyst objectives.

For inquiries, please contact us at [info@malamaproject.org](mailto:info@malamaproject.org).

## Next Steps

1. **Beta Dashboard Release**  
   - Finalizing a user-friendly dashboard for convenient data logging, tokenization, and visualization of carbon metrics.

2. **Open-Source Transition**  
   - Completing security reviews and code polishing before moving our private repository into a **public-facing** GitHub environment.

3. **Further Community Testing**  
   - Rolling out pilot implementations on local farms, gathering live data to refine metrics, and building stakeholder confidence in the solution’s efficacy.
