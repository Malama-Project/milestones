# MALAMA Project - Milestone 2 Resubmission

**Catalyst Proposal:** #1200230  
**Date:** February 2025  

---

## OVERVIEW

During **Milestone 2**, the MALAMA Project continued refining its Cardano-based carbon tracking solution, leveraging feedback from local landowners (Paul & Jeffery), government representatives, and the broader Cardano community. This resubmission provides **structured documentation**, **direct links**, and **photographic evidence**, addressing reviewer requests for clarity and transparency.

We also developed a **mobile-friendly** approach for our upcoming dashboard, ensuring that landowners can manage parcels and log data on the go. The **Mobile UI Preview** section below includes both light and dark mode screenshots.

## KEY UPDATES & CHANGES

1. **Structured Evidence & Direct Links**  
   - We separated each major deliverable (Marketing, Technical Feasibility, Workshops, Farm Tours) into dedicated Markdown files, each with its own GitHub link.

2. **Detailed Farm Tours**  
   - Provided **dates, attendees, feedback, and photos** for the Oct 17 Jeffrey Farm Tour and Oct 17 Paul Farm Tour, clarifying how on-site equipment and processes informed the platform’s design.

3. **Website & App**  
   - Created [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org) as an **explanatory site** offering plain-language guides on carbon credit generation and daily data logging.  
   - [app.malamaproject.org](https://app.malamaproject.org) remains our **functional** environment for credit creation and land parcel management.

4. **Mobile-Friendly Dashboard**  
   - Began integrating **mobile-focused UI/UX** improvements, as shown in our screenshots and the live prototype at [https://malama-labs-nana.vercel.app/](https://malama-labs-nana.vercel.app/).  
   - This addresses landowner feedback that data should be easily updated from the field.

## MOBILE UI PREVIEW

Our **mobile-friendly UI** addresses reviewer feedback for a dashboard that landowners can use on smartphones or tablets. The following images are located in [UI.UX/Malama_Mobile_UI](https://github.com/Malama-Project/milestones/tree/main/UI.UX/Malama_Mobile_UI):

- **[Mobile_Landing_Page_Light.png](https://github.com/Malama-Project/milestones/blob/main/UI.UX/Malama_Mobile_UI/Mobile_Landing_Page_Light.png)**  
  *Landing page in light mode, introducing “Hawaiian Land & Carbon Management” with a call to action.*

- **[Mobile_Login_Light.png](https://github.com/Malama-Project/milestones/blob/main/UI.UX/Malama_Mobile_UI/Mobile_Login_Light.png)**  
  *Login screen requesting username and password; a “Register” option is available.*

## WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH AUDITORS

We invite **auditors** and **community advisors** to:

- **Request private code demonstrations** (until security checks are complete).  
- **Schedule video calls** or follow-up discussions on data privacy or UI/UX enhancements.  
- **Offer feedback** that strengthens MALAMA’s alignment with Cardano Catalyst goals.

**Contact**: [info@malamaproject.org](mailto:info@malamaproject.org)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Beta Dashboard Release**  
   Finalizing a mobile-first interface for data logging, token creation, and carbon metric visualization, integrating features tested in the prototype at [malama-labs-nana.vercel.app](https://malama-labs-nana.vercel.app/).

2. **Open-Source Transition**  
   Completing security reviews before publishing our private repository for public collaboration.

3. **Further Community Testing**  
   Launching pilot implementations on local farms, refining metrics with real-time data.
