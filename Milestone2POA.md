# MALAMA Project - Milestone 2 Resubmission

**Catalyst Proposal:** #1200230  
**Date:** February 2025  

---

## OVERVIEW

During Milestone 2, the MALAMA Project continued refining its Cardano-based carbon tracking solution, leveraging feedback from local landowners (Paul & Jeffery), government representatives, and the broader Cardano community. This resubmission provides **structured documentation**, **direct links**, and **photographic evidence**, addressing reviewer requests for clarity and transparency.

---

## KEY UPDATES & CHANGES

- **Structured Evidence & Direct Links**  
  Separated evidence into dedicated markdown files (Marketing, Technical Feasibility, Workshops, Farm Tours), each with its own GitHub link.

- **Detailed Farm Tours**  
  Provided **dates, attendees, feedback, and photos** for the Oct 17 Jeffrey Farm Tour and Oct 17 Paul Farm Tour.

- **Created malamaproject.org**  
  Offers plain-language guides explaining our on-chain approach to carbon credit generation and daily data logging.

## WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH AUDITORS

We invite auditors and community advisors to:

- **Request private code demonstrations** (until security checks are complete).  
- **Schedule video calls** or follow-up discussions on data privacy or UI/UX enhancements.  
- **Offer feedback** that strengthens MALAMA’s alignment with Cardano Catalyst goals.

**Contact**: [info@malamaproject.org](mailto:info@malamaproject.org)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Beta Dashboard Release**  
   Finalizing a mobile-first interface for data logging, token creation, and carbon metric visualization.

2. **Open-Source Transition**  
   Completing security reviews before publishing our private repository for public collaboration.

3. **Further Community Testing**  
   Launching pilot implementations on local farms, refining metrics with real-time data.
