Overview
The Open Office meeting facilitated an informal discussion among participants, focusing on several key topics. Dominick reported issues with server access, pinpointing a potential router configuration mismatch that he will troubleshoot. The meeting also covered the recent sports results, with Derrick sharing that his team lost in the semi-finals but highlighted an upcoming playoff series. Brad Trivers' text about new tariffs impacting US-Canada trade prompted a discussion on potential incorporation in Canada, as well as American products being pulled from Canadian liquor stores. Dominick outlined his work on server access and API functionalities, which faced environmental variable challenges, and he plans to test the API locally while resolving the access issues. The group explored the idea of a D-rep marketplace and the integration of metadata, while hardware upgrades, specifically routers, were also considered to enhance performance. The meeting briefly touched on advancements in AI tools, like the new Deep Research feature from Chat GPT, before addressing the recent incident involving an AI notetaker that was removed from the call. Action items were established, primarily centered on troubleshooting and product development.
