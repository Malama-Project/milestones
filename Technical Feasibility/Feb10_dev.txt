Overview
The Open Office meeting focused on several key technical and development areas, starting with discussions on Wallet Connect and API issues, where Derrick reported challenges with DREP ID, and Dominick proposed using a state key to resolve the problem. The team then transitioned to frontend development, with Derrick updating on wallet connect enhancements and Agueda contributing ideas for UI design, inspired by a dashboard mockup shared by Tyler. The meeting included a review of the data model for feedstock and its relevance to a proof of concept for potential investors. Attention was given to biomass testing protocols, examining initial testing procedures, storage options, and the tracking of energy usage for lifecycle assessments. The facility design and process flow were deliberated to optimize setup for weighing and testing biomass, with an emphasis on ensuring quality control through robust testing procedures that distinguish between lab and on-site testing. Action items were allocated, including updates to the wallet connect implementation, UI development, and the establishment of clear testing protocols for biomass.
