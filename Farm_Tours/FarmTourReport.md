# Farm Tour Report

**Project:** MALAMA Project  
**Milestone:** 2  
**Date:** February 2025  

---

## 1. Introduction

On October 17, 2024, the MALAMA Project team arrived in Maui for **in-depth, on-site visits** at Paul’s and Jeffery’s farms. During these tours, we observed **equipment** and **processes** related to biomass handling, composting, and preliminary carbon-sequestering activities. These first-hand insights clarified the need for **clear, accessible** educational resources—leading us to **create** and expand [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org) to explain our Cardano-based solution.

## 2. Travel & Budget Considerations

- **Flight Itinerary**: Dallas → Houston → Denver → Kahului → Honolulu → Chicago → Dallas  
- **Justification**: In-person observations yield critical feedback on farmers’ day-to-day operations, equipment use, and data-logging challenges—far beyond what remote discussions can achieve.  
- **Financial Management**: While on-site visits incur significant travel and logistical expenses, the **practical insights** gained justify the investment, informing robust CIP-721 implementations and farmer-friendly interfaces.

## 3. Tour Summaries

### 3.1 Jeffery’s Farm (Oct 17–18, 2024)
- **Observations**:  
  - **Equipment**: Primarily for **biomass processing** (e.g., grinding or shredding feedstock) and compost integration.  
  - **Future Plans**: The farm is exploring a potential **biochar kiln** or pyrolysis approach but **does not yet** have a pyrolysis unit.  
  - **Measurements**: Considering how to track emissions or feedstock properties once a more advanced setup is in place.

- **Key Feedback**:  
  - Jeffery wanted a **simple, approachable explanation** of CIP-721 NFTs and carbon credit generation.  
  - Emphasized the need for an **app** (or user-friendly platform) that **thoroughly explains** how the MALAMA Project works, including CIP-721 minting, real-time data tracking, and eventual carbon credit issuance.

**Resulting Actions**:  
- Decided to **expand** [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org) with plain-language guides, visual diagrams, and step-by-step tutorials on on-chain data flows.  
- Laid the groundwork for a **beta dashboard**, aiming to walk landowners through CIP-721 minting and automated carbon metrics logging.

### 3.2 Paul’s Farm (Oct 21, 2024)
- **Observations**:  
  - **Equipment**: Compost spreaders, mobile data-collection tools (phone apps), and basic feedstock processing stations.  
  - **Processes**: Trench composting, water usage tracking, and plans to incorporate CIP-721 metadata fields (e.g., moisture reduction, energy consumption).

- **Key Feedback**:  
  - **Mobile-Friendly Dashboard**: Logging data in the field should be intuitive and require minimal steps.  
  - **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Farmers need a straightforward method to track daily tasks that could directly feed into on-chain metrics and CIP-721 NFTs.

**Resulting Actions**:  
- Reinforced the website’s role by adding “How It Works” sections and an FAQ explaining day-to-day usage.  
- Prioritized a “quick-entry” approach for the upcoming beta UI, ensuring farmers can capture relevant data efficiently.

## 4. Outcomes & Action Items

1. **Website Refinements**  
   - Enhanced [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org) to include dedicated sections on **equipment**, **process flows**, and **CIP-721 fundamentals**.  
   - Introduced a “quick guide” for landowners, mapping farm tasks to relevant on-chain data points.

2. **Beta Dashboard Focus**  
   - A **mobile-first** design to accommodate farmers monitoring equipment in the field.  
   - Automation of CO2eq calculations based on daily logs (e.g., feedstock input, moisture levels).

3. **Future Pilots**  
   - Other landowners, reached via the Maui Farmers Association, may participate once the beta dashboard is stable.  
   - Additional farm tours planned for 2025 to validate new app features and expand user acceptance.

## 5. Conclusion

These **farm tours** (Oct 17–21, 2024) offered comprehensive insights into **biomass processing** equipment and composting operations on both farms. Direct engagement revealed the **urgent need** for a thoroughly explained blockchain approach, prompting the expansion of [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org) and prioritizing a **user-friendly beta dashboard**. By aligning CIP-721 NFT logic with real-world farming workflows, MALAMA is crafting a **practical, transparent** solution that respects both **budget constraints** and the **day-to-day realities** of agricultural operations.
