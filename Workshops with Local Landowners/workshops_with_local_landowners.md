# Workshops with Local Landowners Report

**Project:** MALAMA Project  
**Date:** February 2025  

---

## 1. Introduction

The MALAMA Project has placed a strong emphasis on **hands-on engagement** with local landowners to shape the development of our Cardano-based carbon tracking solution. This report focuses on the **workshops and farm tours** conducted with our primary collaborators, **Paul and Jeffery**, as well as additional farmers who have shown interest in our platform. The outcomes of these activities directly influenced the creation of [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org/) and set the stage for a **beta dashboard** release in the next milestone.

## 2. Workshop Overview

1. **Daily Meetings with Paul & Jeffery**  
   - **Frequency**: Nearly daily stand-ups or calls, ensuring continuous feedback loops on evolving project features.  
   - **Discussion Topics**:  
     - How CIP-721 tokenization can simplify carbon tracking for farm activities.  
     - Status updates on website content aimed at explaining the carbon credit process.  
     - In-progress features for the upcoming **beta dashboard**, ensuring user-friendly data input and real-time feedback on carbon metrics.

2. **Farm Tours with Additional Landowners**  
   - **Purpose**: Demonstrate the MALAMA Project’s approach in real-world settings and gather immediate feedback from other Maui farmers.  
   - **Activities**:  
     - Showed how data on biochar production, composting, and regenerative practices could be **tokenized** on the blockchain.  
     - Discussed the potential benefits of **on-chain transparency** for carbon credits and sustainability reporting.  
   - **Outcomes**:  
     - Received requests for simplified data-entry interfaces compatible with mobile devices.  
     - Identified a preference for step-by-step guides and visuals in marketing materials.

**Supporting Evidence**:  
- Workshop agendas, sign-in logs, and informal notes located in the `Marketing_Community_Engagement` folder.  
- Photos of farm tours and discussions stored privately (due to anonymity requests from participating farmers).

## 3. Key Results & Deliverables

1. **Creation of [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org/)**  
   - **Farmers’ Need**: Simple, jargon-free explanations of blockchain benefits and carbon-sequestration tracking.  
   - **Our Response**: Built a **dedicated website** to:  
     - Provide educational content on CIP-721 NFTs.  
     - Present real-world use cases of biochar and other carbon-increasing activities.  
     - Offer a contact form for farmers to stay informed or request pilot participation.  

2. **Dashboard Planning for Next Milestone**  
   - **Feedback**: Workshop attendees wanted a **clear, user-friendly interface** where they can log daily farm data and immediately see the resulting carbon metrics.  
   - **Beta Dashboard**:  
     - Currently under active development, with **UI/UX** prototypes in the `UI.UX` folder.  
     - Set to be included in our **next milestone**, featuring early data visualization tools and straightforward data-entry forms.  
   - **Continuous Landowner Input**:  
     - Paul and Jeffery, as well as other farmers who participated in the tours, are **testing** or **reviewing** design mocks to ensure the final product meets real-world agricultural needs.

3. **Ongoing Landowner Engagement**  
   - **Open Communication**: Regular calls (nearly daily with Paul & Jeffery) to review progress on the dashboard’s development, answer blockchain-related questions, and refine acceptance criteria.  
   - **Future Workshops**: Additional farm tours and regional meetups planned as the project moves into the **beta phase** for the dashboard, ensuring the solution remains farmer-focused and user-friendly.

**Supporting Evidence**:  
- Website commits logged in the `GitHub Commits` folder, referencing the creation and updates to [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org/).  
- **UI/UX** mockups in the `UI.UX` folder, demonstrating initial designs for data-entry fields, dashboards, and mobile-friendly views.

## 4. Lessons Learned & Next Steps

1. **Continuous Farmer Feedback is Key**  
   - Daily interactions with Paul & Jeffery have allowed us to **quickly pivot** on design decisions and user requirements.  
   - Farm tours have expanded our network of interested landowners, offering broader perspectives on the platform’s usability.

2. **Education & Clarity Drive Adoption**  
   - Many farmers remain unfamiliar with NFT or blockchain terminology; a **plain-language** approach to marketing and user onboarding is essential.  
   - The success of [malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org/) has reaffirmed the importance of accessible educational content.

3. **Technical & UX Convergence**  
   - Insights from the workshops feed directly into **technical feasibility** considerations for CIP-721 metadata size, off-chain storage, and front-end synchronization.  
   - The planned **beta dashboard** will unify these insights, providing a tangible interface that merges **on-chain logic** with **user-centric design**.

**Next Steps**  
- **Complete** the initial version of the **beta dashboard**, targeting real-world testing with Paul, Jeffery, and other engaged landowners.  
- **Refine** CIP-721 data structures as needed based on feedback regarding transaction costs, data upload frequency, and user experience.  
- **Plan** additional workshops to introduce the beta dashboard and gather broader feedback for subsequent milestones.

## 5. Conclusion

Our workshops and farm tours with local landowners have been **instrumental** in shaping the MALAMA Project’s direction. The **nearly daily discussions** with Paul and Jeffery—paired with broader community engagement on-site—directly led to:

- The launch of a **comprehensive website** ([malamaproject.org](https://www.malamaproject.org/)) tailored to farmers’ informational needs.  
- The **upcoming beta dashboard**, focused on enabling straightforward, on-chain data entry and carbon metric visualization.  

As we progress toward our next milestone, we remain committed to **farmer-driven**, **community-focused** development. We look forward to strengthening these partnerships and delivering a robust platform for **verifiable carbon-tracking** and **agricultural innovation**.
