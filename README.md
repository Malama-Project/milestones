# MALAMA Project - Milestones

Welcome to the **MALAMA Project** repository, dedicated to tracking milestones and public-facing documents for our Cardano Catalyst Proposal **#1200230**. Our mission is to build a blockchain-based system for **verifiable carbon sequestration**, collaborating closely with local landowners in Maui.

---

## Project Overview

The MALAMA Project leverages **CIP-721 NFTs**, **Plutus scripts**, and an intuitive front-end dashboard to help farmers record, tokenize, and validate their carbon-sequestering efforts. By anchoring these records on the **Cardano** blockchain, we aim to ensure **immutability**, **auditability**, and **transparency**.
