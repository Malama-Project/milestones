## 3. Pilot Testing Report with User Feedback

### Field Testing with Landowners

We conducted testing with two local stakeholders representing over 800 acres:
- **Jeffrey Wise (CEO)**  
- **Paul Apao (CSO)**

Their feedback helped refine the user flow, map behavior, and dashboard structure.

## 4. Ongoing Legal Compliance Documentation

### Incorporation & Legal Planning

The legal team has:

- Formally incorporated the Malama Project in Hawaii.
- Ensured backend compliance with data sovereignty standards.
- Drafted disclaimers for participation in carbon markets.

## Final Notes

This milestone submission marks the successful completion of the Malama Project's concept phase as outlined through Project Catalyst.

We have delivered:

- A functional, verifiable beta platform.
- Field-tested tools with active landowners.
- Real-time blockchain integration for transparent carbon tracking.
- A legally incorporated framework ready for scale.

**Though this concludes our concept milestone, development and deployment will continue as we expand our network, strengthen verification tools, and empower more regenerative land stewards across Hawaii and beyond.**

Thank you to the Catalyst community for helping us bring this vision to life.
